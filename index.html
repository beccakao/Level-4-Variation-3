		A free bird leaps on the back Of the wind and floats downstream Till <br> the current ends and dips his wing In the orange suns rays And dares <br> to claim the sky. But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage Can s<br>eldom see through his bars of rage His wings are clipped and his feet <br>are tied So he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fe<br>arful trill Of things unknown but longed for still And his tune is hear<br>d on the distant hill for The caged bird sings of freedom. The free bir<br>d thinks of another breeze And the trade winds soft through The sigh<br>ing trees And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright Lawn and he n<br>ames the sky his own. But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of drea<br>ms His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream His wings are clipped <br>eand his fet are tied So he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird si<br>ngs with A fearful trill of things unknown But longed for still and hi<br>s Tune is heard on the distant hill For the caged bird sings of f&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
